This is a to-do list app. There are many others like it, but this one is mine.

Seriously though, this is a simple to-do list app that I wrote after taking the Udacity Android Development course.
It uses many of the concepts taught as well as some other bells and whistles. In particular:

*  An SQLite database to store checklists, tasks, and the state of those tasks
*  A content provider for storing and retrieving data
*  A home-rolled fling gesture listener for deleting task items
*  A cursor adapter for the checklist to strikethrough task text and ensure the state of the checkbox is
   maintained
*  A context menu for removing checklists

At this point it pretty much works (or at least seems to). I added a little art work so it looks a little more 
professional, but please note that this was not the focus of the project.
